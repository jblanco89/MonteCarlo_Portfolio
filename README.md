The image above shows the output simulation after trying 90.000 random values by using the Monte-Carlo Method. 
In this case, I have calculated the Sharpe ratio and also compared it with the minimum volatility output. After getting the best results, I wanted to try a random portofolio configuration in order to determine the Sharpe ratio location in the simulation plot. 
The red cross represents the Max Sharpe Ratio.
The green cross represents Minimum Volatility Ratio
Black cross represents Sharpe Ratio of the Real Portfolio 
In this case I've tried onñy with cryptocurrencies sucha as: LTC, SOL, CAKE, ADA and RAY
